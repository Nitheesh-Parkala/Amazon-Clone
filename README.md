# Amazon-Clone
I have designed a website that provides an overview of an Amazon-like platform using HTML and CSS. The website aims to mimic the look and feel of the Amazon website by utilizing the HTML and CSS languages.

By using HTML, I have structured the content of the website, including headings, paragraphs and links. HTML allows for the organization of information and the creation of a coherent structure for the web pages.

CSS has been employed to enhance the visual appearance of the website. With CSS, I have applied styles, such as colors, fonts, margins, and padding, to various elements of the web pages. This allows for a consistent and visually appealing design throughout the website.

Overall, the project showcases a simplified representation of an Amazon-like website, demonstrating the use of HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly and visually engaging web interface
